                <dd>I'm a lucky husband to a wonderful wife and a father to two of the best girls a dad could ask for. I
                    come from a decade of military and law enforcement, and more recently I was a systems administrator for
                    a couple years. I'm driving to achieve a career in web application development.</dd>
                <br />
                <dd>My wife and my kids are of the utmost importance to me. I also am loyally dedicated to my few closest
                    friends. Outside of that, I earnestly desire to never stop learning, especially in the realm of
                    application and software development on the internet.</dd>

                <dt>More About Me</dt>
                <dd>At this point, a web application developer/engineer with a focus on the front-end is my biggest goal and
                    dream. Eventually, I want to become proficient at the full stack of development in this arena.</dd>

                <dd>Grizzly Bear, Elliott Smith, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Jr. are some of the artists
                    whom I frequently enjoy listening to.</dd>
